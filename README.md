# Square Array

## Objectives

Square all the elements in an array
Complete spec/square_array.rb and build a method that squares all the elements of an array (assuming they are integers).

## Restrictions

Please use an iterator and implement your own logic.  Don't use any built in array methods other than each. (collect, inject, etc.)
